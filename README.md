The network-uri package
=======================

This package provides facilities for parsing and unparsing URIs, and creating
and resolving relative URI references, closely following the URI spec, IETF
RFC 3986 [1].

The main module in this package, `Network.URI`, was split off from the
network package in the network-2.6 release.
